# huphoria

A learning project in C  

Like [harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon), bookmarking things but for the command line and system wide.

eg:
capture a command as a 'bookmark' by choosing from 'history' or directly editing huphoria's data file.

```
cd ~/.config/nvim && tmux a -t neovim
```
